# SEWA Frontend

This React + TypeScript app provides the clinician-facing UI for SEWA. All AI outputs are explainable, uncertainty is displayed, and every action is logged for audit. No autonomous diagnosis is performed; all results require human review.

- Built with React + TypeScript
- Connects to backend API for image upload, AI inference, and review
- Designed for safety, explainability, and auditability
